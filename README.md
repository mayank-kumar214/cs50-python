## 📌 About This Course

**CS50's Python** is an excellent beginner-to-intermediate level course covering:
- Python syntax and concepts  
- Conditionals, loops, functions  
- File handling and exceptions  
- Libraries like `cs50`  
- Testing and debugging  
- And more!

I'm documenting my learning journey here by saving all weekly assignments in separate folders.
